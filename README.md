# Win32Tutorial
Source code for my YT tutorial

You can find the source code in the root, as Source.cpp
And the executable should be found in /x64/Debug (Win32Tutorial.exe)

You can download everything (in this exact folder structure) to open in Visual Studio as a project

Please do not edit the code, this is a download of source code meant to help people who cannot figure out code from the video.
